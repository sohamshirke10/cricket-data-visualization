Cricket Data Analytics and Visualization

## Problem Statement :

In this project, a Power BI Dashboard was developed to analyze and compare the performances of all players participating in the ICC T20 Men's Cricket World Cup 2024. The dashboard provides an interactive platform to evaluate player performances and facilitates the selection of the best 11 players of the tournament, based on specific performance criteria outlined in the problem statement.
## Datasource :
Web Scrapped all the data from [ESPN WorldCup 2024](https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/icc-men-s-t20-world-cup-2024-1411166) using python and jupyter notebook

## Data Collection:
Scrapped all the data regarding match and world cup and all details about players career using Beautiful Soup library and Jupyter Notebook is used to convert the json files into the dataframes and then these dataframes into csv file for further data analysis on power bi.

## Data Transformation:
Performed initial data cleaning after scrapping such as player name correction, handle missing value, match id linking etc. using Pandas. Transformed the final data for dashboard using Power Query of Power BI.

## Data Modelling:
Connected all the datasets with based on some defined primary keys such as team and match ids. Also, created many measures, calculated columns and parameters for data analysis and dash boarding using DAX.

## Reports:
Data visualization for the dataset was done using Microsoft Power BI Desktop:
