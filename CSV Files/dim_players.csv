Ghani was also good enough to race to a century in his fourth ODI, against Zimbabwe, still aged 17. He started 2014 as part of the Afghanistan Under-19 team that defeated Australia and Sri Lanka in the Under-19 World Cup, and ended it as a member of the squad for Afghanistan's first full World Cup campaign. He warmed up for the tournament with a match-winning hundred against an Auckland team that included Kyle Mills and Mitchell McClenaghan.Liam Brickhill"
Ibrahim Zadran,Afghanistan,"https://img1.hscicdn.com/image/upload/f_auto,t_ds_square_w_640,q_50/lsci/db/PICTURES/CMS/383200/383225.png",Right hand Bat,Right arm Medium fast,Opening Batter,"Top-order batter Ibrahim Zadran is among Afghanistan's most consistent performers, and young enough to have made his Test debut (in the team's third ever match) before he played a white-ball international. He made 87 in that match in Chattogram, a big, historic win over Bangladesh."
Najibullah Zadran,Afghanistan,"https://img1.hscicdn.com/image/upload/f_auto,t_ds_square_w_640,q_50/lsci/db/PICTURES/CMS/383200/383226.png",Left hand Bat,Right arm Offbreak,Middle order Batter,"Najibullah Zadran packs a punch with his bellicose left-hand batting, despite his slight frame. He has followed the same tried and tested route to the national side as many of his generation that came after the initial Afghan cricketing pioneers, with age-group cricket preparing him for the big stage. His ODI debut, against Ireland in Dublin in 2012, was possibly a little premature but Zadran's batting turned a corner in 2014 and he started to look more at home. In July, his second-innings 99 helped Afghanistan beat a strong Zimbabwe A side in an unofficial Test, and in November his unbeaten 32-ball 60 helped set up a 54-run win over Pakistan A in a Twenty match. He started 2015 well with a maiden ODI fifty, a boundary-laden 83 against Ireland, and cruised into Afghanistan's World Cup squad.Liam Brickhill"
Gulbadin Naib,Afghanistan,"https://img1.hscicdn.com/image/upload/f_auto,t_ds_square_w_640,q_50/lsci/db/PICTURES/CMS/383200/383231.png",Right hand Bat,Right arm Medium fast,Batting Allrounder,"Gulbadin Naib's first love in the sporting world was amateur bodybuilding, not cricket. When he eventually did take the game up, however, he progressed quickly through Afghanistan's age group sides as a batting allrounder and was the youngest member of the team that won the Division Five tournament in 2008 - the first stepping stone to the full world stage."
Mohammad Nabi,Afghanistan,"https://img1.hscicdn.com/image/upload/f_auto,t_ds_square_w_640,q_50/lsci/db/PICTURES/CMS/383200/383215.png",Right hand Bat,Right arm Offbreak,Allrounder,"Mohammad Nabi hails from a well-to-do family that moved to Peshawar in Pakistan, seeking a safe haven from the Soviet War in Afghanistan. An efficient allrounder - a strong middle-order batsman who can bowl flighted offspin - Nabi's rise, like Afghanistan's, has been staggering. He has been at the centre of the side since their time in the ICC's World Cricket League Division Five, from where Afghanistan began their rise to the international stage."
Rashid Khan,Afghanistan,"https://img1.hscicdn.com/image/upload/f_auto,t_ds_square_w_640,q_50/lsci/db/PICTURES/CMS/320500/320506.png",Right hand Bat,Legbreak Googly,Bowling Allrounder,"Rashid Khan has been Afghanistan's first global superstar, and the key to their successes in their early years in international cricket. His extraordinarily effective legspin has made him one of the greatest T20 bowlers ever, among the first names on wishlists of teams in leagues all around the world. "
Azmatullah Omarzai,Afghanistan,"https://img1.hscicdn.com/image/upload/f_auto,t_ds_square_w_640,q_50/lsci/db/PICTURES/CMS/383200/383229.png",Right hand Bat,Right arm Medium fast,Allrounder,"A fast-bowling allrounder who can bowl in the powerplay and hit big sixes down the order is always a prized asset in cricket, and Azmatullah Omarzai is no different."
Mujeeb Ur Rahman,Afghanistan,"https://img1.hscicdn.com/image/upload/f_auto,t_ds_square_w_640,q_50/lsci/db/PICTURES/CMS/383200/383240.png",Right hand Bat,Right arm Offbreak,Bowler,"He can bowl traditional offspin and mix it up with legspin and ripping googlies to make what Afghanistan coach Andy Moles terms a ""complete package"". At just 16, Mujeeb wants to follow in the footsteps of Rashid Khan, his senior by two years. There's plenty of hype surrounding him too, supported by the weight of his performances. "
Fazalhaq Farooqi,Afghanistan,"https://img1.hscicdn.com/image/upload/f_auto,t_ds_square_w_640,q_50/lsci/db/PICTURES/CMS/383200/383236.png",Right hand Bat,Left arm Fast medium,Bowler,

He was the player of the match in the final and was named the Best Emerging Player of the tournament."

But the country has struggled to unearth quality batting prospects at the same rate as their bowling unit. The emergence of the hard-hitting Hazratullah Zazai is a sign that this may change early in the country's Full Member era.
David Warner,Australia,"https://img1.hscicdn.com/image/upload/f_auto,t_ds_square_w_640,q_50/lsci/db/PICTURES/CMS/316500/316589.png",Left hand Bat,Legbreak,Opening Batter,David Warner's extraordinary batting feats in all three formats for Australia will forever be overshadowed by his role as the chief protagonist of the Newlands ball-tampering scandal of 2018 and his place as a central figure in Australian cricket's ensuing cultural crisis.
Travis Head,Australia,"https://img1.hscicdn.com/image/upload/f_auto,t_ds_square_w_640,q_50/lsci/db/PICTURES/CMS/321500/321584.png",Left hand Bat,Right arm offbreak,Top order Batter,"A talented, aggressive left-hand batter earmarked for big things at a young age, it was Travis Head's second coming as an international cricketer where his career really took off. In late 2021 he was recalled for the Ashes series and made a match-defining 85-ball century at the Gabba - it set the tone for a strong of destructive Test innings while he also reemerged as a white-ball force, so central to Australia's 2023 ODI World Cup plans that they waited for him to recover from a broken hand. In the final against India he made 137 off 120 balls. A cult hero was born."
Mitchell Marsh,Australia,"https://img1.hscicdn.com/image/upload/f_auto,t_ds_square_w_640,q_50/lsci/db/PICTURES/CMS/385700/385798.png",Right hand Bat,Right arm Medium,Allrounder,"Part of one of the most well-known family names in Australian cricket, Mitchell Marsh, an allrounder who can hit 140kph and hard-hitting middle-order batsman, has been an alluring prospect for Australia in all three formats but has struggled to cement his place at international level despite some outstanding performances on the big stage."
Marcus Stoinis,Australia,"https://img1.hscicdn.com/image/upload/f_auto,t_ds_square_w_640,q_50/lsci/db/PICTURES/CMS/321500/321596.png",Right hand Bat,Right arm Medium,Batting Allrounder,"A powerful, versatile batter and medium-pace bowler, Marcus Stoinis has become a mainstay in Australia's limited-overs sides as well as a dominant player in the BBL and a sought-after player in the IPL. "
Glenn Maxwell,Australia,"https://img1.hscicdn.com/image/upload/f_auto,t_ds_square_w_640,q_50/lsci/db/PICTURES/CMS/316600/316657.png",Right hand Bat,Right arm Offbreak,Batting Allrounder,"One of the fastest scorers in world cricket, Glenn Maxwell has lit up the limited-overs formats and, at times, shown he can transfer that to the red ball. It is not just his power that worries opposing bowlers and captains. His ability to make unconventional shots appear routine - reverse sweeps and pulls, for example - makes it hard to set fields to cover all of his scoring areas. His audacity comes with risk, and he can exasperate as well as exhilarate, but at his best he can change a game in moments."
Matthew Wade,Australia,"https://img1.hscicdn.com/image/upload/f_auto,t_ds_square_w_640,q_50/lsci/db/PICTURES/CMS/316500/316594.png",Left hand Bat,Right arm Medium,Wicketkeeper Batter,It has been a career of reinvention for Matthew Wade as he went from Test wicketkeeper to specialist middle-order batsman to T20I World Cup winning wicketkeeper/finisher via a prolific run in domestic cricket when it appeared his international days were over.
Pat Cummins,Australia,"https://img1.hscicdn.com/image/upload/f_auto,t_ds_square_w_640,q_50/lsci/db/PICTURES/CMS/316600/316692.png",Right hand Bat,Right arm Fast,Bowler,"Earmarked as a potential star from a young age, Pat Cummins made his Test debut as an 18-year-old but had to wait six years for his next appearance as injuries struck a body that could not withstand the workload. The bowler who emerged in 2017 was a thoroughbred quick who became one of the standout players in the world and, in late 2021, Australia's Test captain in dramatic circumstances."
Adam Zampa,Australia,"https://img1.hscicdn.com/image/upload/f_auto,t_ds_square_w_640,q_50/lsci/db/PICTURES/CMS/321500/321549.png",Right hand Bat,Legbreak Googly,Bowler,"An energetic and competitive legspinner, Adam Zampa emerged in Australia's limited-overs squads in 2016 after a successful summer for South Australia and the Melbourne Stars. In T20, especially, he has proven a hard man to get away, with subtle changes of pace and variations, including a wrong'un and straight ball making up for a lack of prodigious turn. He's a (mullet-wearing) colourful character off the field, but in contrast, his bowling, focusing on control, is clinical."
Josh Hazlewood,Australia,"https://img1.hscicdn.com/image/upload/f_auto,t_ds_square_w_640,q_50/lsci/db/PICTURES/CMS/316600/316622.png",Left hand Bat,Right arm Fast medium,Bowler,"A tall and accurate fast bowler who is unrelenting in his line and length, Josh Hazlewood became a fixture in Australia's Test attack as soon as he made his debut in December 2014. Although he was only 23 at the time, the baggy green had felt a long time coming, given that Hazlewood had been highly regarded for so long. At 17, he had become the youngest fast bowler to be selected by New South Wales, and at 19 he was in his first one-day international against England at Southampton, joining Craig McDermott and Ray Bright as the only Australian 19-year-olds to play the format so soon. Hazlewood was initially chosen for Australia's Test tour of India in late 2010 but was withdrawn due to a back stress injury, and it was not until four years later that he finally played his first Test, having added significant strength to his 196cm frame."
Tim David,Australia,"https://img1.hscicdn.com/image/upload/f_auto,t_ds_square_w_640,q_50/lsci/db/PICTURES/CMS/340300/340305.png",Right hand Bat,Right arm Offbreak,Middle order Batter,"Mumbai Indians' decision to sign Tim David for INR 8.25 crore (AUD 1.5 million) at the 2022 IPL auction confirmed two things. Firstly, that the game's formats had diverged so much that a man without a state contract or even a first-class appearance to his name could be worth such a sum; and secondly, that David had become one of the world's most sought-after T20 finishers over the previous 12 months."
Mitchell Starc,Australia,"https://img1.hscicdn.com/image/upload/f_auto,t_ds_square_w_640,q_50/lsci/db/PICTURES/CMS/316600/316644.png",Left hand Bat,Left arm Fast,Bowler,"First there was Johnson, then there was Starc. A left-armer called Mitchell has been a staple of Australia's attack for more than a decade and seems set to remain so for the foreseeable future. While Johnson was more express, Starc is still quick enough to make life uncomfortable for opposition batsmen, especially with the bounce gained from his 1.96m height - and boasts greater control of swing than his former colleague. Never was that shown to greater effect than during the 2015 World Cup, when Starc was at times unplayable, his inswingers rattling stumps and trapping batsmen in front throughout the competition. Not surprisingly he was named Player of the Tournament for his 22 victims at 10.18, and four years later he would claim 27 wickets at the World Cup in England when Australia's defence ended in the semi-finals."
Ashton Agar,Australia,"https://img1.hscicdn.com/image/upload/f_auto,t_ds_square_w_640,q_50/lsci/db/PICTURES/CMS/321500/321559.png",Left hand Bat,Slow Left arm Orthodox,Bowler,"Ashton Agar initially turned almost as many heads as he has turned cricket balls. At the age of 19 he had a place in the squads of Western Australia, Perth Scorchers, and the national team, having sensationally been upgraded from an internship on the 2013 tour of India to a more expansive role in Michael Clarke's squad.

Najmul Hossain Shanto,Bangladesh,"https://img1.hscicdn.com/image/upload/f_auto,t_ds_square_w_640,q_50/lsci/db/PICTURES/CMS/323100/323155.png",Left hand Bat,Right arm Offbreak,Top order Batter,"Nazmul Hossain Shanto emerged from an unusual source in Bangladesh cricket - the schools. A double-century in a school one-day match in Rajshahi grabbed the attention of age-group scouts, who quickly drafted the left-hander into Bangladesh's Under-17s. Soon, he graduated to the Under-19s in 2013, and went on to play two World Cups at that level, in 2014 and 2016."
Soumya Sarkar,Bangladesh,"https://img1.hscicdn.com/image/upload/f_auto,t_ds_square_w_640,q_50/lsci/db/PICTURES/CMS/385800/385821.png",Left hand Bat,Right arm Medium fast,Middle order Batter,"A rarity among Bangladesh allrounders, top-order batter Soumya Sarkar bowls medium pace rather than spin, and occasionally even takes the new ball. "
Litton Das,Bangladesh,"https://img1.hscicdn.com/image/upload/f_auto,t_ds_square_w_640,q_50/lsci/db/PICTURES/CMS/319700/319727.png",Right hand Bat,,Wicketkeeper Batter,Liton Das is the first wicketkeeper-batsman in Bangladesh considered good enough to be a long-term successor to Mushfiqur Rahim. His domestic exploits for Abahani in the Dhaka Premier League and Rangpur Division in the National Cricket League in the 2014-15 season earned him recognition and later a call-up in the senior side for the Test against India in Fatullah in June 2015.
Mohammad Rishad Hossain,Bangladesh,"https://img1.hscicdn.com/image/upload/f_auto,t_ds_square_w_640,q_50/lsci/db/PICTURES/CMS/382800/382809.png",Right hand Bat,Legbreak Googly,Bowler,"Rishad Hossain emerged as one of Bangladesh's best performers at the 2024 T20 World Cup - he finished equal (with Rashid Khan) on 14 wickets, in third place, which was even more impressive since he comes from a country with almost no history of fielding legspinners at the highest level.temperament, unflustered by the big occasion and ready to do battle against the top teams."
Tanzid Hasan,Bangladesh,"https://img1.hscicdn.com/image/upload/f_auto,t_h_100_2x/lsci/db/PICTURES/CMS/368000/368062.1.png",Left hand Bat,,Opening Batter,"Tanzid Hasan pipped the likes of Mohammad Naim, Rony Talukdar and Soumya Sarkar among Bangladesh's openers who could replace Tamim Iqbal in the long term. Tanzid's nickname is also Tamim, and many have found similarities between the two, at least in their aggression at a young age. For just how long Tanzid can stay on as the first choice, depends on his consistency."
Najmul Hossain Shanto,Bangladesh,"https://img1.hscicdn.com/image/upload/f_auto,t_ds_square_w_640,q_50/lsci/db/PICTURES/CMS/323100/323155.png",left hand Bat,Right arm Offbreak,Top order Batter,"Although he made his debut in 2017, and scored two Test hundreds in 2021, it took Najmul Hossain Shanto more than five years to truly establish himself in the Bangladesh side. But once he did, he was rewarded by being appointed Bangladesh's captain in all three formats."
Jaker Ali,Bangladesh,"https://img1.hscicdn.com/image/upload/f_auto,t_ds_square_w_640,q_50/lsci/db/PICTURES/CMS/349300/349343.png",Right hand Bat,,Wicketkeeper Batter,

A middle-order batter who bowls useful offspin, he is also one of Bangladesh's best fielders of all time. Mahmudullah's numbers put him in the modern group of allrounders who have aggregated 10,000 runs, 100 wickets and 100 catches in international cricket across formats."
Taskin Ahmed,Bangladesh,"https://img1.hscicdn.com/image/upload/f_auto,t_ds_square_w_640,q_50/lsci/db/PICTURES/CMS/316700/316703.png",Left hand Bat,Right arm Fast,Bowler,"Even before he was anywhere near making his international debut, Taskin Ahmed became an internet sensation. A video of his spell against England Under-19s in 2012 found its way to Youtube, and the sight of a Bangladeshi fast bowler ripping it past batsman and hitting the wicketkeeper's gloves quite hard and high made people curious."
Towhid Hridoy,Bangladesh,"https://img1.hscicdn.com/image/upload/f_auto,t_ds_square_w_640,q_50/lsci/db/PICTURES/CMS/380200/380236.png",Right hand Bat,Right arm offbreak,Top order Batter,"Towhid Hridoy could be the next big batting mainstay for Bangladesh. His 918 runs across formats in 2023, his first year in international cricket, gave the team management a strong option, especially amid a long overall batting struggle from the rest of the line-up in the same period."
Mustafizur Rahman,Bangladesh,"https://img1.hscicdn.com/image/upload/f_auto,t_ds_square_w_640,q_50/lsci/db/PICTURES/CMS/319700/319734.png",Left hand Bat,Left arm Fast medium,Bowler,"Mustafizur Rahman is a left-arm pace bowler who came to Dhaka to try out for a fast-bowling camp in 2012, after he had impressed in an Under-17 tournament in Satkhira, some 300km from Dhaka. He got admitted to the BCB's pace foundation and soon caught the coaches' attention to make the Bangladesh Under-19 side for the 2014 World Cup. "

As a bowler, Shakib is accurate, consistent and canny; aggression and a wide range of strokes are the keys to his batting. Even more importantly, he has self-belief and an excellent temperament, unflustered by the big occasion and ready to do battle against the top teams."
Tanzim Hasan Sakib,Bangladesh,"https://img1.hscicdn.com/image/upload/f_auto,t_ds_square_w_640,q_50/lsci/db/PICTURES/CMS/382800/382811.png",Right hand Bat,Right arm Fast medium,Bowler,"Tanzim Hasan Sakib was Bangladesh's best-performing fast bowler in the T20 World Cup in 2024. He took 11 wickets at an average of 13.54, with a career-best bowling performance of 4 for 7 against Nepal. Tanzim bowled with pace, extracting seam or swing offered by conditions and the mostly favourable pitches in the USA and the West Indies. He was so good at the World Cup that the Bangladesh team management couldn't use Shoriful Islam for even one match after Tanzim had replaced the in-form left-arm quick at the start of the tournament."
Mahedi Hasan Miraz,Bangladesh,"https://img1.hscicdn.com/image/upload/f_auto,t_ds_square_w_640,q_50/lsci/db/PICTURES/CMS/380200/380237.png",Right hand Bat,Right arm Offbreak,Allrounder,"Mehedi Hasan Miraz has emerged as one of the brightest young stars in Bangladesh cricket. He led the country to their first appearance in an Under-19 World Cup semi-final in February 2016, before making the year more memorable with his Test debut, against England in October."
Jos Buttler,England,"https://img1.hscicdn.com/image/upload/f_auto,t_ds_square_w_640,q_50/lsci/db/PICTURES/CMS/316600/316642.png",Right hand Bat,,Wicketkeeper Batter,"England have had many players down the ages who have gained world acclaim, but Jos Buttler is arguably their first global Twenty20 superstar. Buttler helped bring England's limited-overs batting into the 21st century, his impact on the one-day and T20 sides extraordinary as they turned a group-stage exit in the 2015 World Cup into a triumph on home soil four years later, with his efforts with the bat and the gloves crucial to their Super-Over victory in the final. In an 18-month period from mid-2014, he scored what at the time were England's three fastest one-day hundreds - thrilling innings against Sri Lanka at Lord's, New Zealand at Edgbaston and, topping the list, a 46-ball onslaught against Pakistan in Dubai. He has also shone at the IPL, and has quickly become a senior player in the Test side since his surprise recall in 2018."

Jonny Bairstow,England,"https://img1.hscicdn.com/image/upload/f_auto,t_ds_square_w_640,q_50/lsci/db/PICTURES/CMS/383100/383157.png",Right hand Bat,Right arm Medium,Wicketkeeper Batter,"Jonny Bairstow, the son of the former England wicketkeeper David Bairstow, is a combative wicketkeeper-batter who has become a cricketer to be reckoned with in England's middle order. The journey was far from easy for Bairstow, especially with Jos Buttler in contention for the gloves, but prolific run-making for Yorkshire eventually made a case that England's selectors could not ignore. Galvanised by his selection, runs flowed."
Will Jacks,England,"https://img1.hscicdn.com/image/upload/f_auto,t_ds_square_w_640,q_50/lsci/db/PICTURES/CMS/383100/383155.png",Right hand Bat,Right arm Offbreak,Batting Allrounder,"It was a quirk of circumstance that Will Jacks' first standout performance as an England player was a six-wicket haul in a Test match rather than a characteristically dominant white-ball innings. Jacks became the first England debutant spinner since 1993 to claim a five-for on Test debut in 2022, setting up a famous win in Rawalpindi. Not only was it his maiden first-class five-for, he was not even meant to be in the side: he was a late change to the side before the toss with Ben Foakes ruled out through illness."
Harry Brook,England,"https://img1.hscicdn.com/image/upload/f_auto,t_ds_square_w_640,q_50/lsci/db/PICTURES/CMS/383100/383145.png",Right hand Bat,Right arm Medium,Batter,"A former England U19s captain, Harry Brook announced himself as a player with a bright future with a remarkable T20 Blast season in 2020, averaging 55 and striking at 163 in the group stages despite batting in the middle order."

But, after building a reputation as an elegant batter, it was his offspin bowling that earned him the call-up when England were left reeling from the surprise retirement of Graeme Swann."
Liam Livingstone,England,"https://img1.hscicdn.com/image/upload/f_auto,t_ds_square_w_640,q_50/lsci/db/PICTURES/CMS/383100/383152.png",Right hand Bat,Legbreak,Batting Allrounder,"The sense that Liam Livingstone is a domineering batting talent who will end up playing all three formats for England was strengthened by an excellent maiden Championship double-century for Lancashire against Warwickshire at Old Trafford in 2017. He had begun the season billed as the ""belligerent face of England's next generation"" after a successful England Lions tour of Sri Lanka, and England took an early look at him with two T20 appearances against South Africa before deciding that he needed more time to craft his game at county level. That double-hundred suggested his research was coming along just fine."

One Test later, he scooped his maiden Man-of-the-Match award, after four first-innings wickets and a thrilling counter-attacking half-century had given England the edge in a gripping Edgbaston Test against India.

With a natural, whippy action that generated easy pace, he immediately stood out even in that most competitive of fields - Pakistani fast bowling. A year later, he was making his Pakistan debut in Brisbane, though not before adversity touched him; he would lose his mother just before he received his first Pakistan cap. "

Fakhar Zaman,Pakistan,,Left hand Bat,Slow Left arm Orthodox,Opening Batter,"Born in Mardan, where the standard of batsmanship will always be measured by arguably Pakistan's greatest Test batsman Younis Khan, Fakhar Zaman has been on Pakistan's thankless domestic circuit for over five years with almost no attention. A left-handed opener with an unusually high backlift, Zaman relies on timing for his runs, which he's made plenty of. This is illustrated by his domestic average (42 in first class cricket and 49 in List A). But it wasn't until the Quaid-e-Azam trophy in 2016-17 that his form began to be noticed. Zaman scored 663 runs in the competition at an average of 51, including 170 in the second innings of the final, a game dominated by the twin centuries of former Pakistan captain Salman Butt."

Matthew Cross,Scotland,,Right hand Bat,,Wicketkeeper Batter,"A wicketkeeper-batsman from Aberdeen, Matthew Cross broke into the Scotland side in 2013. He had earlier made a good impression as vice-captain of Scotland U19s during the 2012 U19 World Cup. Cross hit two half centuries as an aggressive opener to help Scotland qualify for the 2015 World Cup at the World Cup Qualifiers in New Zealand in 2014. But he struggled badly in the summer of 2014, and a total of just 15 runs in four ODIs prompted the Scottish selectors to move him down the order for the World Cup acclimatisation tour. "

Michael Leask,Scotland,,Right hand Bat,Right arm Offbreak,Allrounder,"Michael Leask is an explosive batsman from Aberdeen. He showed as much when he smeared five sixes during a memorable 16-ball 42 in an ODI against England in May 2014. But he has been hampered by inconsistency, and he only mustered 56 runs at an average of 9.33 during the World Cup Qualifiers in 2014. Leask also bowls useful off-spin, taking three wickets in Scotland's win over Tasmania in their World Cup acclimatisation tour in autumn 2014.
Leask played a solitary first-class game for Northants in a tour match against New Zealand A in 2014. He moved on to Somerset ahead of the 2016 season with Somerset's director of cricket Matt Maynard describing him as a ""feisty cricketer"". A scattering of T20 matches were his only outings in his debut season.

He had played only 16 first-class innings before he made his Test debut at the age of 20, and had hit only one first-class hundred before he made a maiden Test ton. That hundred - the 176 against Australia at Pallekele - was a match-flipping, series-defining knock, which given the fact no other batsman mustered more than 55 in the game, is one of the greatest ever Sri Lankan innings. Since then, Mendis has put together some impressive ODI innings as well, and has embedded himself in the Test top four. "
